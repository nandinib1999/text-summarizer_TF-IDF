This program accepts a text file using cmd argument --filepath and it returns an extractive summary of the text. The summary may not be completely accurate but it manages to give a fair idea to the user about the text.

## Usage

There's one commandline argument that needs to passed while running the script i.e. **--filepath**. It accepts the path to the txt file which needs to be summarized.

In Anaconda Prompt or CMD, run
```
python text_summarizer.py --filepath="articles/article.txt"
```
