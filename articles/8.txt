Federer won the Swiss Indoors last week by beating Romanian qualifier Marius Copil in the final. The 37-year-old claimed his 99th ATP title and is hunting the century in the French capital this week. Federer has been handed a difficult draw where could could come across Kevin Anderson, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal in the latter rounds. But first the 20-time Grand Slam winner wants to train on the Paris Masters court this afternoon before deciding whether to appear for his opening match against either Milos Raonic or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. "On Monday, I am free and will look how I feel," Federer said after winning the Swiss Indoors. "On Tuesday I will fly to Paris and train in the afternoon to be ready for my first match on Wednesday night. "I felt good all week and better every day. "We also had the impression that at this stage it might be better to play matches than to train. "And as long as I fear no injury, I play." Federer's success in Basel last week was the ninth time he has won his hometown tournament. And he was delighted to be watched on by all of his family and friends as he purchased 60 tickets for the final for those dearest to him. "My children, my parents, my sister and my team are all there," Federer added. "It is always very emotional for me to thank my team. And sometimes it tilts with the emotions, sometimes I just stumble. "It means the world to me. It makes me incredibly happy to win my home tournament and make people happy here. "I do not know if it's maybe my last title, so today I try a lot more to absorb that and enjoy the moments much more consciously. "Maybe I should celebrate as if it were my last title. "There are very touching moments: seeing the ball children, the standing ovations, all the familiar faces in the audience. Because it was not always easy in the last weeks."
